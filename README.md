# 📌 **Overview**
**Rust Zero‑to‑Hero: 50 Projects** is a structured, project‑based learning roadmap where you build **one Rust project per day**.  
Designed for real‑world skills and long‑term mastery, this repo prepares you for a future where Rust becomes increasingly important as major companies — including Microsoft — shift away from C++ toward safer, modern systems languages.

This roadmap is divided into four stages:

1. **Beginner** – syntax, ownership, borrowing, CLI basics  
2. **Intermediate** – traits, generics, modules, file I/O, APIs  
3. **Systems** – threads, channels, async, concurrency  
4. **Advanced** – web frameworks, databases, microservices, WASM

# 🦀 **Why Rust Will Be More Important in the Future**

Rust is rapidly becoming one of the most important programming languages for the next decade. Its focus on **memory safety**, **performance**, and **modern systems design** positions it as the natural successor to C and C++ in many critical areas.

## 🔐 1. Security‑Driven Future
Most large‑scale vulnerabilities come from memory‑unsafe languages. Rust eliminates entire classes of bugs such as:
- buffer overflows  
- use‑after‑free  
- data races  

## 🏢 2. Microsoft’s Shift Away From C/C++
Major companies — especially **Microsoft** — are moving toward Rust for long‑term modernization.  
Microsoft engineers have publicly stated goals to **reduce or eliminate C/C++** in favor of Rust for safer infrastructure.

## ⚙️ 3. Industry‑Wide Adoption
Rust is now used in:
- AWS (Firecracker)  
- Google (Android & Linux kernel contributions)  
- Meta (backend systems)  
- Cloudflare (networking stack)  

## 🚀 4. Future‑Proof Skills
Learning Rust today prepares developers for:
- systems programming  
- cloud infrastructure  
- embedded development  
- security‑critical software  
- high‑performance applications

## ⚔️ Rust vs C/C++ — Why Rust Wins the Future

Rust is not replacing C/C++ overnight — but it *is* becoming the modern, safer successor for new systems.

### 🔐 Memory Safety
- **Rust:** Guarantees memory safety at compile time  
- **C/C++:** Prone to buffer overflows, use‑after‑free, data races  

### ⚡ Performance
- **Rust:** Zero‑cost abstractions, same speed as C/C++  
- **C/C++:** Extremely fast, but unsafe by default  

### 🧵 Concurrency
- **Rust:** Fearless concurrency with compiler‑checked thread safety  
- **C/C++:** Concurrency errors are common and dangerous  

### 🛡️ Security
- **Rust:** Eliminates entire classes of vulnerabilities  
- **C/C++:** Responsible for the majority of modern security flaws  

### 🏗️ Modern Tooling
- **Rust:** Cargo, crates.io, built‑in testing, formatting, linting  
- **C/C++:** Fragmented tooling, inconsistent build systems  

### 🔄 Industry Direction
- **Rust:** Adopted by Microsoft, Google, AWS, Meta, Cloudflare  
- **C/C++:** Legacy codebases remain, but new secure systems avoid it  

### 🎯 Final Notes
Rust brings **C/C++ performance** with **modern safety**, **modern tooling**, and **future‑proof design**.  
For new systems — especially AI, cloud, and security‑critical software — Rust is the clear winner.

## 🍀 Good Luck, Learner
This roadmap is your journey from zero to mastery — one project, one concept, one day at a time.
