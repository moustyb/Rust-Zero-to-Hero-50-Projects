# 📌 **Overview**
**Rust Zero‑to‑Hero: 50 Projects** is a structured, project‑based learning roadmap where you build **one Rust project per day**.  
Designed for real‑world skills and long‑term mastery, this repo prepares you for a future where Rust becomes increasingly important as major companies — including Microsoft — shift away from C++ toward safer, modern systems languages.

This roadmap is divided into four stages:

1. **Beginner** — syntax, ownership, borrowing, CLI basics  
2. **Intermediate** — traits, generics, modules, file I/O, APIs  
3. **Systems** — threads, channels, async, concurrency  
4. **Advanced** — web frameworks, databases, microservices, WASM  

Each project includes:
- 🧠 Concept focus  
- 📝 One‑sentence explanation  
- 📁 Folder structure  
- 🚀 Clear progression
