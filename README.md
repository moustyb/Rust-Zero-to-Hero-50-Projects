# 📌 **Overview**
**Rust Zero‑to‑Hero: 50 Projects** is a structured, project‑based learning roadmap where you build **one Rust project per day**.  
Designed for real‑world skills and long‑term mastery, this repo prepares you for a future where Rust becomes increasingly important as major companies — including Microsoft — shift away from C++ toward safer, modern systems languages.

This roadmap is divided into four stages:

1. **Beginner** – syntax, ownership, borrowing, CLI basics  
2. **Intermediate** – traits, generics, modules, file I/O, APIs  
3. **Systems** – threads, channels, async, concurrency  
4. **Advanced** – web frameworks, databases, microservices, WASM
