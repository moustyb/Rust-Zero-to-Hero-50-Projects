# 📌 **Overview**
**Rust Zero‑to‑Hero: 50 Projects** is a structured, project‑based learning roadmap where you build **one Rust project per day**.  
Designed for real‑world skills and long‑term mastery, this repo prepares you for a future where Rust becomes increasingly important as major companies — including Microsoft — shift away from C++ toward safer, modern systems languages.

This roadmap is divided into four stages:

1. **Beginner** – syntax, ownership, borrowing, CLI basics  
2. **Intermediate** – traits, generics, modules, file I/O, APIs

# 🦀 **Why Rust Will Be More Important in the Future**

Rust is rapidly becoming one of the most important programming languages for the next decade. Its focus on **memory safety**, **performance**, and **modern systems design** positions it as the natural successor to C and C++ in many critical areas.

## 🔐 1. Security‑Driven Future
Most large‑scale vulnerabilities come from memory‑unsafe languages. Rust eliminates entire classes of bugs such as:
- buffer overflows  
- use‑after‑free  
- data races  

This makes Rust the strongest candidate for secure systems programming.

## 🏢 2. Microsoft’s Shift Away From C/C++
Major companies — especially **Microsoft** — are moving toward Rust for long‑term modernization.  
Microsoft engineers have publicly stated goals to **reduce or eliminate C/C++** in favor of Rust for safer infrastructure.

## ⚙️ 3. Industry‑Wide Adoption
Rust is now used in:
- AWS (Firecracker)  
- Google (Android & Linux kernel contributions)  
- Meta (backend systems)  
- Cloudflare (networking stack)  

This momentum signals a long‑term industry shift.

## 🚀 4. Future‑Proof Skills
Learning Rust today prepares developers for:
- systems programming  
- cloud infrastructure  
- embedded development  
- security‑critical software  
- high‑performance applications  

Rust is not a trend — it’s a **strategic evolution** in how modern software is built.

## 🎯 Summary
Rust’s combination of **safety**, **speed**, and **modern tooling** makes it one of the most important languages for the next 10 years. As companies like Microsoft move away from C/C++, Rust is becoming the new foundation for secure, reliable systems.


4. **Systems** – threads, channels, async, concurrency  
5. **Advanced** – web frameworks, databases, microservices, WASM
